# Hello World!

This is a basic example how to use RIOT in your embedded application.
It prints out the famous text `Hello World!`.
The code itself may look like your usual *C* beginners hello-world example.

## Getting started
**1. Open a terminal and navigate to the application directory.**

**2. Build the application by executing GNU Make.**
```sh
$ make all
```

**3. Flash the built firmware image into the board's memory.**
```sh
$ make flash
```
**4. Initiate a serial communication with the board.**
```sh
$ make term
```

**5. Reset your board by pressing the 'Reset' button. You should see the "Hello World!" message.**

```sh
main(): This is RIOT! (Version: 2022.04-devel)
Hello World!
```

## Intro to RIOT build system
This example should foremost give you an overview how to use the Makefile system.
Let's take a look at the `Makefile` file in the application directory:

* First you must give your application a name, which is commonly the same as the name of the directory it resides in.

* Then you can define a default BOARD for which the application was written.
  By using e.g. `make BOARD=nrf52840dk` you can override the default board.

* The variable `RIOTBASE` contains an absolute or relative path to the directory where you have checked out RIOT.
  If your code resides in a subdirectory of RIOT, then you can use `$(CURDIR)` as it's done in here.

* The variable `QUIET`, which is either `1` or `0`, defines whether to print verbose compile information, or hide them, respectively.

* The last line of your Makefile must be `include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include`.
