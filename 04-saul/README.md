# SAUL: interacting with sensors and actuators

SAUL is a generic actuator/sensor interface in RIOT. Its purpose is to enable
unified interaction with a wide range of sensors and actuators through a set of
defined access functions and a common data structure.

Each device driver implementing this interface has to expose a set of predefined
functions and it has to register itself to the central SAUL registry. From here
devices can be found, listed, and accessed.

Each device exposes its name and type. This information can be used for
automated searching and matching of devices (e.g. connect light sensor
automatically with the color of an RGB LED...).

To learn more about SAUL and the registry, check the online documentation
[here](https://doc.riot-os.org/group__drivers__saul.html) and
[here](https://doc.riot-os.org/group__sys__saul__reg.html).

## Task 1

Test the application and verify that when the sensed temperature surpasses the
threshold of 26 °C the LED color switches to red.

**Hint**: Touch the temperature sensor on the side of your board
to change the measured temperature (it is labeled HDC1000).

**1. Build and flash the application. Open a serial port communication.**
```sh
$ make all flash term
```

## Task 2

Modify the application to toggle the LEDs when temperature surpasses 27 °C.

**1. Modify the threshold value.**

**2. Build and flash the application again**

## Phydat

The phydat module provides a common view on physical data throughout RIOT.
This data is typically the output from sensor readings, data aggregation, and
also the input for actuators.

The structure is defined as follows:
```C
typedef struct {
    int16_t val[PHYDAT_DIM];    /**< the 3 generic dimensions of data */
    uint8_t unit;               /**< the (physical) unit of the data */
    int8_t scale;               /**< the scale factor, 10^*scale* */
} phydat_t;
```

A `phydat_t` structure contains data of a specific physical magnitude.
Depending on the magnitude (determined by the `unit` field), 1, 2, or 3 of the
positions of the `val` array will be used. A humidity value would require only
one dimension, whereas a position or acceleration may require three dimensions.
The scale is expressed as power of 10 (10 ^ factor).

Let's use our application as an example. When we perform a temperature reading
we pass a pointer to a `phydat_t` structure, where the result will be stored.
```C
phydat_t result;
int dimensions = saul_reg_read(temperature_device, &result);
```

The `saul_reg_read` function returns the number of dimensions that the read
value occupies (i.e. how many positions of the `val` array are valid). Let's
assume that the current temperature is 25.5 °C. As we are reading a temperature
value, `dimensions` will be `1`. If we check the value of `result.unit`, it will
equal `UNIT_TEMP_C`. In the particular case of our sensor, the value is
expressed with a factor of `10^-3`, so `scale` will contain the value `-3`. The
value stored in `val[0]` will be `2550`.

For more information about phydat, like units and provided functions, check the
[online documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org/group__sys__phydat.html).

## Task 3

Modify the application to also read values from the onboard accelerometer.

**1. Find the onboard accelerometer, by searching for a device of type `SAUL_SENSE_ACCEL` using `saul_reg_find_type`.**
```C
saul_reg_t *accel_sensor = saul_reg_find_type(SAUL_SENSE_ACCEL);
```

**2. Modify the main loop to perform a read with the accelerometer.**
**Print the read value with `phydat_dump`:**
```C
/* read an acceleration value from the sensor */
phydat_t acceleration;
int acc_dim = saul_reg_read(accel_sensor, &acceleration);
if (acc_dim < 1) {
    puts("Error reading a value from the device");
    break;
}

phydat_dump(&acceleration, acc_dim);
```

**3. Build and flash the application. Open a serial port communication.**

## Task 4

Detect when your board has been flipped 180 ° and turn the LED2 on.

**1. Check the current value of the acceleration on the Z axis.**
**To access the value of the Z dimension, use `acceleration.val[2]`.**
**When comparing account for measurement error (e.g. +- 100 mG)**

**2. If the value surpasses than the threshold, turn the LED on (`LED2_ON`).**
**Don't forget the turn the LED off (`LED2_OFF`) when the value does not surpass the threshold.**

**3. Build and flash the application. Open a serial port communication.**
